# 03-PasswordWithJavaScript
---


## Description 
This Webpage is responsive (so it adapts to multiple screen sizes) and will generate a random password based on the following criteria:
   
   * The length of the password should be at least 8 characters but no more than 128 characters
    
   * The character types should include:
        - lowercase
        - uppercase
        - numeric
        - special characters 

A button will allow the user to generate the password. The user is presented with a series of prompts for password criteria. He should pick the characters length and then each character types the password would need to have. At least one type of character needs to be chosen. The password is generated with the selected character types and length. It is then written to the page.
Finally, another button allows the user to copy the password to clipboard.
