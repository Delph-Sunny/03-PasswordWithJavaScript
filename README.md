## Description 
This Webpage is responsive (so it adapts to multiple screen sizes) and will generate a random password based on the following criteria:
   
   * The length of the password should be at least 8 characters but no more than 128 characters
    
   * The character types should include:
        - lowercase
        - uppercase
        - numeric
        - special characters 

The user is presented with a series of prompts for password criteria. He should pick the characters length and then each character types. The password is generared using at least once each of the character type. It is then either displayed in an alert or written to the page.
